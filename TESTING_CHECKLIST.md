## 🚀 End-to-End Workflow Test

### Prepare Test Environment

1. **Create `.env` file**
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with real test data**
   ```
   APP_URL=https://your-actual-app.com
   TEST_USER_EMAIL=your-test@email.com
   TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-test-password
   ```
   - [ ] `.env` file created
   - [ ] Real application URL added
   - [ ] Valid test credentials added

3. **Verify credentials work**
   - [ ] Manually log into application with test credentials

### Test 1: Generate Your First Test

**Objective**: Create a simple login test

1. **Run Command**: "Generate New E2E Test"
   - [ ] Command executes without errors

2. **Provide Information**:
   - Test Name: `login-flow`
   - Starting URL: `[your-app]/login`
   - Behavior Steps:
     ```
     1. Navigate to login page
     2. Enter email address
     3. Enter password
     4. Click login button
     5. Verify dashboard is visible
     ```
   - Expected Outcome: "User is logged in and sees dashboard"
   - [ ] All information provided

3. **Verify Browser Plugin Execution**
   - [ ] Browser plugin navigates to login page
   - [ ] Browser plugin enters credentials
   - [ ] Browser plugin clicks login
   - [ ] Browser plugin verifies success
   - [ ] No errors during browser verification

4. **Verify Test File Generation**
   - [ ] `tests/login-flow.spec.ts` created
   - [ ] File contains proper imports
   - [ ] File uses `process.env` for credentials
   - [ ] File has descriptive comments
   - [ ] File uses Playwright best practices (getByRole, etc.)

5. **Verify Test Execution**
   - [ ] Test runs automatically after generation
   - [ ] Test passes on first attempt (or within 5 attempts)
   - [ ] No runtime errors

6. **Verify Supporting Files**
   - [ ] `test-behaviors/login-flow.md` created
   - [ ] Behavior doc contains all steps
   - [ ] `.cursor/commands/self-heal-login-flow.md` created
   - [ ] Self-heal command has correct test path

7. **Verify in Headed Mode**
   - [ ] Run: "Run Test in Headed Mode"
   - [ ] Select: `login-flow.spec.ts`
   - [ ] Browser window opens
   - [ ] Can see each action happening
   - [ ] Test completes successfully

### Test 2: Run Test Suite

**Objective**: Verify test execution commands work

1. **Run All Tests**
   - [ ] Command: "Run All Tests"
   - [ ] Shows test execution progress
   - [ ] Displays summary (Total, Passed, Failed)
   - [ ] HTML report generated
   - [ ] Can open report in browser

2. **Run Single Test**
   - [ ] Command: "Run Single Test"
   - [ ] Shows list of available tests
   - [ ] Can select test
   - [ ] Test runs successfully
   - [ ] Results displayed clearly

3. **Analyze Results**
   - [ ] Command: "Analyze Test Results"
   - [ ] Shows test summary
   - [ ] Lists passed tests
   - [ ] Provides guidance for any failures

### Test 3: Self-Healing Workflow

**Objective**: Verify self-healing capability

**Setup**: Manually break a test to simulate UI change

1. **Modify Test File to Force Failure**
   - Open: `tests/login-flow.spec.ts`
   - Change a locator to something that won't exist
   - Example: Change `getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' })` to `getByRole('button', { name: 'NonExistentButton' })`
   - [ ] Test file modified

2. **Run Test to Confirm Failure**
   - [ ] Command: "Run Single Test"
   - [ ] Select: `login-flow.spec.ts`
   - [ ] Test fails as expected
   - [ ] Error message is clear

3. **Manually Verify Behavior Works**
   - [ ] Open browser manually
   - [ ] Can complete login successfully
   - [ ] Confirmed behavior still works

4. **Run Self-Heal Command**
   - [ ] Command: "Self-Heal Login Flow Test"
   - [ ] AI verifies behavior with browser plugin
   - [ ] New test file generated
   - [ ] Test passes after regeneration

5. **Verify Fixed Test**
   - [ ] Run test again
   - [ ] Test now passes
   - [ ] Test file has updated locators

   - [ ] Enter: "Add login test"
   - [ ] Commit succeeds
   - [ ] Confirmation displayed

3. **View Updated History**
   - [ ] Command: "View Commit History"
   - [ ] Shows new commit
   - [ ] Commit message visible

4. **Create Branch**
   - [ ] Command: "Create New Branch"
   - [ ] Enter: "test-experiment"
   - [ ] Branch created successfully
   - [ ] Switched to new branch

5. **Return to Main Branch**
   - [ ] Run: `git checkout main` (or use command if available)
   - [ ] Switched back successfully

6. **Test Rollback (Optional - Careful!)**
   - [ ] Command: "Rollback to Previous Commit"
   - [ ] Shows recent commits
   - [ ] Shows warning about data loss
   - [ ] Creates backup branch
   - [ ] Can successfully rollback
   - [ ] Can restore from backup if needed

### Test 5: Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling

1. **Test Generation with Invalid URL**
   - [ ] Run: "Generate New E2E Test"
   - [ ] Provide invalid URL
   - [ ] System detects and reports error clearly
   - [ ] Suggests next steps

2. **Test Generation with Impossible Behavior**
   - [ ] Run: "Generate New E2E Test"
   - [ ] Describe behavior that doesn't exist in app
   - [ ] Browser verification fails
   - [ ] Clear error message
   - [ ] Test generation stops (doesn't create bad test)

3. **Self-Heal Without Manual Verification**
   - [ ] Try to self-heal when behavior is actually broken
   - [ ] System attempts healing
   - [ ] Reports if unable to create working test
   - [ ] Provides clear guidance
